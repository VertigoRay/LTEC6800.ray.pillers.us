# Learning Objectives/Standards Addressed

- 

# Goals

*(The goal of the game, not the lesson objectives)*

- The goal of the game is to provide a space for users to be able to play and learn *any* subject at *any* level of mastery.
- Motivate players to play by rewarding them with gamification strategies and financial incentives (Levitt, List, Neckermann, & Sadoff, 2011).
- Improve skills in all study areas that are engaged regularly.
- As an MMO, the player will have many options for advancement. Regardless of the path, the goal is to increase level in a subject area which will improve the level of skill and the level of the player.

# Rules

Many MMOs are RPGs that rely purely on combat scenarios to level a player. While combat scenarios will definitely be available for a type of progression, they will not be the fundamental leveling mechanism in this game. The combat scenarios will be required to hone teamwork, colaboration, and resource gathering that is needed for other areas of the game. The other areas of the game will include questing, crafting, dungeons, and events.

Rules will vary based on what the player must do in order to complete a scenario, such as questing, dungions, crafting, or events.

# Storyline

The once united Earth has spread across the galaxy and universe through the discovery of a wormhole network that had a node just outside the Sol System. After thousands of years of exploration and colonization, an unknown, unexpected, and seemingly unprovoked event caused the wormhole network to collapsed. This left hundred of thousands of colonies stranded to fend for themselves. For millennia, many of them endured while a vast majority fell to extinction. A millennia has passed, and the Earth is but a fable as the human race begins to reform governmental structures and organize themselves.

Cloning and mind uploading (the ability to upload human memories to a central datacenter) are basic technologies that has been maintained by all of the factions from the initial, brutal space expansion era. Warp technology, however, was lost when the connection to Earth was severed as all warp-capable ships were manufactured solely in the Sol System.

No sentient alien species have been discovered. However, there are many alien species that have been discovered and proven useful for resources, food, and domestication. Many predator species have also been discovered, but due to the savage nature of these species, they are easily kept at bay by base defenses.

# Characters/Roles

The are five known human races left from the dispersion of humans across the universe.

- Shiksier
  
  A tribal race that leans on local laws and socialized central services.

- Dudine

  A mostly democratic society that has evolved with a capitalist mindset, but respect for individualism and human rights.

- Arnac

  This race is ruled by capitalist dictators that are fiercely focused on strict laws and beurocractic policies.

- Onoid
  
  Mostly resembling androids, their cloning technology is used to create only bare necesity organs, while most organ functions are synthesized.

- Inean

  A highly religious race that elevates spirit and self discovery over the advancement of the race.

*Other races may exist, but they have not made themselves known to this central collective.*

# Problems/Tasks/Missions

Questing is one of two primary methods for advancing a character.
A quest will normally be given by a NPC.
The quest is pre-configured by an educator to have desirable learning objectives.
It can have a wide-range of objectives with and equally diverse range of learning objectives.
Examples of quests include:

- Finding tints and dyes in the wild to mix into desired colors.
- Scavenging for ingredients from the environment. The quantities of the ingredients may need to be derived from a word-problem or by solving a puzzle that will result in quantity needed.
- Creating genetically superior plants by breeding plants with desired trates.
- Survival tactics were the character is placed in a scenario where they must use their wits to survive a grueling or time-based trial. The trial may require eating, lodging, and wild-life survival skills. Alternatively, surviving may require concocting an antedote to a poison that was injested.

Crafting is the second of the two primary methods for advancing a character. Crafting outcomes will always very depending on the in-game weather, geographic locations (such as altitude), and countless other factors. An expert smith, might be able to create an exquisite hammer 99% of the time, but occasionally they will be tired and forget to watch the tempterature of the oven and the quality will be affected. Likewise, an master baker from the coast may need to re-discover cooking times and temperatures needed for a basic loaf of bread while they are exploring a mountainous region. Artisticly inclined players may enjoy designing new art, sculptures, buildings, and ships; of course they will need *virtual* ingredients to bring their designs to *virtual* reality.

Dungeons are special scenarios where players team up to accomplish a shared task. Dungeons are mostly randomized events with a common theme, allowing a learning objective to be taught over and over again without muscle memory coming into play and reducing the ability for blogs and walkthroughs to be written on the exact solution. Dungeons may also include escape room elements with puzzles, decryption, acrostics, hidden messages, scavenging, magnetic locks, and other acceptable riddles.

Events are special opportunities that may occur for a short period of time or indefinitely. Events may be based on a real holiday bringing social experiences to the game. Other events may include helping [Project Discovery](https://www.projectdiscovery.org) to determine if exoplanets exist; [much like Eve Online has done](https://www.eveonline.com/discovery).

# Number of Players

MMOG (Massively Multi-player Online Game)

# Estimated Length of Gameplay

Since the game is an MMO with teaching objectives at every level of education, this game can ostensibly be played indefinitely.

A single play-session should include some form of accomplishment to occur in the session. The play-session should be normally completed within an hour and have an upper limit of two hours. Some special-events or advanced dungeons may last longer.

# Content Integration

| **This game teaches academic content.** |  |

**Content integration strategies and rationale:** *(Explain your content integration strategies and rationale in detail.)*

# Engagement Strategies

Many gamification strategies will be employed, including but not limited to: player ranks, badges, in-game titles, peer pressure through teamwork, 

# Scaffolding Strategies
 *(How does the game provide scaffolding?)*

Guidance is always needed for new topics, and explanations will need to feel like they are coming from the NPC, and not necessarily from watching a video in an in game messaging system or library archive.

# Assessment Strategies
*(in-world assessments, out-world assessments, both?)*

Assessments will be done purely in-game. The assessment strategy will validated by course desingers against real standards, and will be certified as actual coursework by learning institutions. Basically, by completing a quest, the player has completed the learning objective satisfactorily.

Due to the nature of the internet, cheating is always a risk when seeking real-world certification. In order to receive real-world credit for the work/quest done, final questing must be done in-world at a certified testing center. Alternative options may be made available in the future.
