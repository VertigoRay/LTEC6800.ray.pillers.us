# Gamify Authoring Learning Games, Sims, and Virtual Environments (LTEC 5240) at the University of North Texas.

This course is exclusively offered in the Maymester, and it was a very strenuous endeavor.
Over the course of three weeks, there were two game designs and nine blog posts.
The first of the games was a beginning-to-end game; which wasa board game with start and finish points on the board.
The second game was a digital game designed in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).
While scratch is easy enough to use, the short timeline led to a very stressful scenario.
Personally, I spent a considerable amount of time working with my classmates to improve their game functionality.
While collaboration is always encouraged in the forum, I gained little from the endeavor; except a "thank you" from both the student and the instructor.
While it was genuinely a selfless act, it could have been incentivized with a gamification.
While, I think an entire course should be gamified for maximum implication, I will focus on the gamification of the digiital game designe project.

Unfortunately, we lose access to course materials after a course is completed. So, I will have to describe [my experience in LTEC 5240 from memory and the notes in my course blog](https://ltec5240.ray.pillers.us).
The gist of the assignment was to create a design document and then create the game.
The design document described the game features, audience, and game play.
This was the second and final assignment, and it took place mostly during the second week of the course.
With such a short timeline and the professor being at a conference during the second week of class, student engagement and motivation was very low.
However, it could have been kept high, even in the absence of the professor, through gamification.
Encouraging student though gamification techniques will enhance engagement, motivation, enjoyment, and create a more productive learning experience (Bohyun, 2015).
The gamification strategies that will be employed for this learning activity are some of the most popular and will be: points, boosters, levels, leaderboards, and badges.

Future work should go into expanding this endeavor accross the entire course (and arguably all UNT LTEC courses).
Especially at the doctoral level with the cohort model, gamified learning across the entire curriculum could bring the students together like never seen before.
I really think these other great gamification strategies could also be implemented at a higher level: PvP quiz battles, open badges, and cohort or program-wide leader boards.

## Gamification Design

Here are several of the gamification strategies and rationals.

### Points

Points are the lifeblood of any game.
Points are how progress is measured, and how accomplishment is measured and felt.

Pints and levels are easily tracked in the user profile.

#### Strategies

Points would be immediately earned by accomplishing tasks:

- Complete readings required for the module and complete the quiz.
- Earn more points by competing in a PvP module quiz; the student that answers fastest wins the point.
  ![PVP Battle Quiz](https://i.imgur.com/v074xxG.png)
- Bonus points for early assignment submissions:
  - An assignment turned-in on the due date would get 1 point.
  - An assignment turned-in one day before the due date would get 2 points.
  - An assignment turned-in two days before the due date would get 3 points and so on.
- Provide an accepted answers to a questions in the question forum.

  - Additional points are awarded for well-liked answers.
  - Question askers can also earn points by asking well-liked questions.
- Provide reviews to student submissions.
  - Bonus points are awarded for well-liked reviews.
- Daily bonus points:
  - Given for liking at least five items; this will encourage social engagement.
  - Being active seven days in a row; this will get accelerated points the longer the streak lasts.

#### Rationale

- Providing immediate feedback, with points serving as that feedback, provides increased motivation (Bohyun, 2015).
- Points act as an external reward (Tsay, Kofinas, & Luo, 2018, p. 3).

### Boosters

Boosters allow temporary or permanent boosts to the the way the game is played.
"Boosters allow people to play the game better; to power up their game-play.
If you think about Super Mario's star ... you get to play the game with more power." (Chou, 2019)

#### Strategies

Access to the **Adobe Stock** booster.
This booster will grant premium access to [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com) for usage with the project; this will be paid for by LTEC.
The booster will be granted at level 4.

#### Rational

- Boosters make the desired actions more effect and efficient (Chou, 2019).
- Graphical elements are one of the two most significant game elements of game-based learning (Subhash & Cudney, 2018). 

### Levels

Points (also known as experience) will eventually lead to an increased level.
As levels increase, the student experience will evolve and improve.

#### Strategies

Contenct (user interface) unlocking is a substancial achievement with measureable benefits. 

##### Level 1

- Ablity to see all course materials.
- Can start the tasks, or should I say quests?

*All students start at this level.*

##### Level 2

- Ability to search the course material.
- Ability to search discussion forums.
- Ability to like articles.

##### Level 3

- Ability to like discussion posts.
- Ability to emoticon articles.

##### Level 4

- Ability to emoticon discussion posts.
- Access to the **Adobe Stock** booster.

##### Level 5

- Ability to edit other user's discussion posts to clean up content; all changes are moderated by the instructor or a higher level student.

#### Rationale

- Levels help trigger competition, cooperation, and progression (Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018).
- Levels are one of the two most significant game elements of game-based learning (Subhash & Cudney, 2018). 
- Levels act as an external reward (Tsay, Kofinas, & Luo, 2018, p. 3).

### Leaderboard

A leaderboard will help students ensure they are keeping pace with the other students in the class.
Leaderboards should include an all-time, course, and assignment leaderboard.
We will focus on the assignment leaderboard.

![All Time Leader Board](https://i.imgur.com/gT8RUE3.png)

#### Strategies

All activities for the assignment will have points associated.
While bonus points can be earned, the leaderboard is an excellent way for a student to see how he or she is pacing in comparison to his or her peers.
The leaderboard will help drive motivation

#### Rationale

- Leaderboards acknowledge student achievement in relation to their peers (Tsay et al., 2018, p. 5,11).
- Review shows that leaderboards, et al., are important game elements (Subhash & Cudney, 2018, p. 205).
- Students routinely check the leaderboard and "calculate how to surpases people" on the leaderboard (Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018, p. 16).

### Badges

![New Badge Awarded](https://i.imgur.com/FLWZoKM.png)

#### Strategies

- Bandwagon strategies will be implemented with the *like* feature.
  - The first student to *like* something that goes viral (viral defined by the professor) will earn a bandwagon badge (which of course also comes with points).
- Being active late at night, one-time.
- Being active on the weekend, one-time.
- Final project ranked badges: gold, silver, and copper.
  ![LTEC 5240 First Place Final Project](https://i.imgur.com/poI4ecm.png)
  ![LTEC 5240 Second Place Final Project](https://i.imgur.com/cmWdpHU.png)
  ![LTEC 5240 Third Place Final Project](https://i.imgur.com/C2o51DJ.png)

#### Rationale

- Badges act as an external reward (Tsay, Kofinas, & Luo, 2018, p. 3).
- While not all students are motivated by badges, some students are "driven to be the first to get a badge." (Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018, p. 17) The system has to be designed to attract a wide audience.

## Gamified Online Collaborative Learning

The gamification platform should be setup and maintained by Information Technology (IT) professionals.
This section assumes that budgets have already been approved, IT has already been involved, and the platform is ready for use.

With at least several months of anticipation, the instructor should ensure the system is functioning and create a student profile to walk-through the assignment and learning activities.
The instructor will act as a moderator and possibly a participant in the game.

Students will start at level 1 and will follow the quests and battles in the platform to walk-through the course work in the appropriate order.
New quests (aka modules or instruction sets) will be unlocked as the student progresses through the assignment.

![Quests, battles, and accomplishments](https://i.imgur.com/NqVuKlW.png)

The Game Design Document and the game development will be done collaboratively, and points will be awarded equally to both students.
However, individual progress through the modules and assesssments are still graded individually even if collaboration is used; it is allowed and expected. 
Students will be guided through the Game Design Document with a number of quests and refreshers designed around the built-in arcade system.

![Addictive arcade games for scaffolding](https://i.imgur.com/IQuBe8w.png)

Once the Game Design Document is approved by the professor, the game design portion of the assignment will commence.
The final game design will submitted in a forum for all students to see.
Every student, not team, will be required to place three ranked (gold, silver, and copper) votes for the games developed by all of the other teams; they cannot rank their own team.
Gold is worth three points, silver is worth two points, and copper is worth one point.
The total points will be summed and the ranked leaders will receive ranked badges depicting their placement in their profile.
All students will receive the points awarded by the voting.

## Gamification Platform

I initially thought about using Canvas for this purpose.
While it certainly may be possible, it was not intuitive.
I requested a test course on [UNT's Canvas](https://unt.instructure.com), but I was not able to configure anything reasonably close to what I wanted.

I quickly found [Accord LMS](https://www.accordlms.com), but it felt like a cheaply made system.
I wanted something that felt more like a game.
I honestly considered custom development, but I knew that would not be a valid consideration for the scope of a single assignment.
As I trogged on across the internet, I found myself at my wits end.
Just when I thought that the ideal platform didn't exist, I found myself outside a home...page.
The home...page had laughter, music, and conversations.
I could hear the rolling of dice and the sound of chips hitting the table.
What form of home...page was this?

Turns out, I had stumbled upon [Growth Engineering](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk).
Growth Engineering's [Academy LMS](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/academy-lms/) is build entirely around gamification.
Academy LMS has [all of the gamification my heart desired](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/academy-lms/academy-lms-feature-list/) and more:

- Points (Experience Points (XP)) (Bohyun, 2015; Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018; Subhash & Cudney, 2018; Tsay et al., 2018)
- Achievements (Boosters) (Bohyun, 2015; Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018; Subhash & Cudney, 2018; Tsay et al., 2018)
- Levels (Bohyun, 2015; Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018; Subhash & Cudney, 2018; Tsay et al., 2018)
- Leaderboards (Bohyun, 2015; Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018; Subhash & Cudney, 2018; Tsay et al., 2018)
- Custom Badges (Bohyun, 2015; Kocadere & Çağlar, 2018; Subhash & Cudney, 2018; Tsay et al., 2018)

Additionally, there are many classroom-specific features build-in:

- Content Management, including:
  - Learner-generated content and curation
  - Surveys
  - Batch creation
- User Management, including the ability to designate:
  - Learners
  - Managers (Teachers)
  - Tutors
  - Experts
- Learnder Assessments
  - Assessments
  - Certifications
  - Compliance testing
  - Automatic learning interventions
- Classroom Management
  - Booking
  - Scheduling
  - iCal Support
- Social Learning
  - Clubs
  - Chats
  - FAQs
  - Experts
- Reporting
- Customisation
  - Re-branding
  - Custom Domains
- Integrations
  - ADFS (UNT's authentication)

This was just the icing on the cake, the list was a mile long.
The only downside is that I needed to schedule time for a demo, and that required a meeting which I could fit into my calendar this week.
Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to play with the program, but I look forward to investigating it in the future.
